                 Understand the theory and intuition behind Autoencoders                                                                 
                 Import Key libraries dataset and visualize images                                                                    
                 Perform image normalization,pre-processing, and add random noise to images                                           
                 Build an Autoencoder using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a backend                                                     
                 Compile and fit Autoencoder model to training data                                                                  
                 Assess the performance of trained Autoencoder using various KPIs
